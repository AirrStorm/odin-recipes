    <img src="pork chops.jpg" alt="pork chops">
    <p>Everyone who has this loves it! It's surprisingly simple and quick. Garlic, rosemary, and white wine flavor the pork. The aroma is wonderful. Try steaming fresh broccoli, then frying it in the pan juices for a perfect side dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 (1 inch thick) pork chops</li>

        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon fresh ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
